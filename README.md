For p1, I used threshold value = 127

p1 and p2 are completed.
I have enccountered with ReadImage, expected pgm error, however it was due to using windows' terminal
as oppose to using Linux. 
To run p1, use two_objects.pgm as input, 127 as threshold, p1_output.pgm as output file name.
To run p2, use p1_output.pgm as, p2_output.pgm as output file name.
The makefile is provided.
